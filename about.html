    <p> I was born in Texas, raised in New York & D.C. and moved to Georgia around 13 years ago. I am the middle child with 8 siblings and we're all very close.

    <h2>These days </h2>
    <p> I currently work for Amazon in the brokerage department. I've worked with Amazon for almost 3 years. My overall work background is in mostly warehousing & exporting </p>

    <p> <h3>Hobbies</h3> 
        I like traveling and hanging out (shopping) with my nieces. On a chill day, you'll find me watching documentaries and reality shows with my iguana, Rocky.
    </p>

    <p> <h3>Goals</h3>
        I plan to stay with Amazon and hopefully become a Software Development Engineer in the next year. I also plan to continue traveling.
