# Unit-8-Personal-Site
Hello World
This is my personal website. 
There's a bit of info about me in each page with links at the top.
I also have a short JavaScript message in the console within the inspect feature.
Use the Index.html as the main website, here is the path you can copy and paste: file:///C:/Users/14045/OneDrive/Documents/Coursework/Unit-8-Personal-Site/index.html  

For the project collaboration, it's in the wrong repo, please see link here if needed: https://github.com/orgs/Tiara-Heads-Personal-Website/projects/1/views/1
